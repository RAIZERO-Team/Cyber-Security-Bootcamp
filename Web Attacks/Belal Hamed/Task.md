## Notes
Each team member is responsible for collecting detailed information on their assigned vulnerabilities. They must provide the following:

1- **Explanation of the Vulnerability:** A detailed description of how the vulnerability works.
2- **Examples:** Real-world examples or scenarios where the vulnerability has been exploited.
3- **Root Cause:** Explanation of why the vulnerability occurs, identifying the underlying technical or process-related reasons.
4- **Mitigation Strategies:** Practical solutions to close or prevent the vulnerability, including code changes, security practices, and configurations.

The goal is to understand how these vulnerabilities arise, why they are critical, and how to mitigate them effectively.
