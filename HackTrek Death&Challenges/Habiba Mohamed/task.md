# Sprint Title: HackTrek: Death & Challenges

## **Network Security Tools**

Network security is essential in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities. Below are some powerful tools used for penetration testing and securing networks:

---
### **1. Metasploit**

- **Function**: Develop and execute exploit code for discovering vulnerabilities and exploiting them.
- **Category**: Exploitation Framework
- **Use case**: Penetration testing, vulnerability exploitation, post-exploitation.
- **Key Feature**: Automates many stages of an attack, including scanning, exploiting, and gaining access.
---
### **2. Wireshark**

- **Function**: Real-time network traffic analyzer that captures and inspects packets.
- **Category**: Packet Analyzer
- **Use case**: Network traffic analysis, identifying network issues, monitoring for suspicious activity.
- **Key Feature**: Detailed packet inspection, supports a wide range of protocols.
---
### **3. Hydra**

- **Function**: A fast and flexible tool to crack passwords for network services using brute-force or dictionary-based methods.
- **Category**: Password Cracking
- **Use case**: Cracking login credentials for remote services (SSH, FTP, HTTP, etc.).
- **Key Feature**: Parallelized attacks on multiple services simultaneously.

### **4. Netdiscover**

- **Function**: A network discovery tool that detects devices on local networks using ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).
- **Category**: Network Discovery
- **Use case**: Identifying devices and hosts within a network, especially in local or isolated networks.
- **Key Feature**: Works well in environments with dynamic IPs and hidden devices.
---
### **5. TheHarvester**

- **Function**: A tool for gathering email addresses, subdomains, and other public information from search engines and social media platforms.
- **Category**: Information Gathering
- **Use case**: Collecting public data for social engineering, penetration testing, and network reconnaissance.
- **Key Feature**: Collects data from multiple sources like Google, Bing, and LinkedIn.

## **CTF Conquerors: Challenges Completed**

### **Conquest:**

- **Nightfill**
    - **Challenge**: A vulnerable virtual machine designed to test multiple penetration testing techniques.
    - **Skills Developed**: Information gathering, password cracking, privilege escalation.
    - **Outcome**: Successfully solved by exploiting weak configurations and securing root access.

---

## **Upcoming Challenges**

- **Nightfill 2.0**: A more advanced version of the previous challenge with additional layers of complexity.
- **Exploit Lab**: Designed to enhance exploitation skills through new vulnerable environments.

---

## **Summary:**

This sprint highlights crucial network security tools necessary for penetration testing and vulnerability exploitation. Completing the **Nightfill** challenge showcases Habiba's expertise in using these tools to solve complex security issues. Stay tuned for the upcoming challenges to continue building on these skills!
